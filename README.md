## Retired Artist/Teacher

Hi, I'm a retired educator and art therapist.
<!--
I'm interested in moving to the neighborhood. Let me know if you know of anyone interested in renting a room or studio for around $600/month.

I'm relocating to the Marietta area and looking for a nice living enviroment. I can assist a senior with shopping and cooking. I'm also a dog trainer, and I enjoy doing creative projects with both children and seniors. My art therapy background includes grief and loss counseling.  

Please contact me at:

Keep me in mind for art projects, storytelling/history sessions, jewelry making with beads, relaxation techniques, play-reading groups, art therapy with children and adults. I'm also available for house sitting, pet sitting and obedience training, running local errands, assistance with older adults.

##### Cheers!
