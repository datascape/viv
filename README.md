## Retired Artist/Teacher

Hi, I'm a retired educator and art therapist. I've worked with children and adults in educational settings.

I'm interested in moving to the neighborhood. Let me know if you know of anyone interested in renting a room for around $600/month.

I can assist a senior with shopping and cooking. I'm also a dog trainer and I enjoy spending time doing creative projects with both children and seniors. My art therapy background includes grief and loss counseling.  

Please contact me at:

Keep me in mind for art projects, storytelling/history sessions, jewelry making with beads, relaxation techniques, play reading groups, art therapy with children and adults. As well as house sitting, local errands, assistance with older adults, pet sitting and obedience training. Cheers!
