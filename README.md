I'm also a dog trainer, and I enjoy doing creative projects with both children and seniors. My art therapy background includes grief and loss counseling.

Keep me in mind for art projects, storytelling/history sessions, jewelry making with beads, relaxation techniques, play-reading groups, art therapy with children and adults. I'm also available for house sitting, pet sitting and obedience training, running local errands, assistance with older adults.

I am offering Women' Groups doing Art Therapy. The groups 
deal with many issues of life and have proven a success. 

Group of 4-6 women for 4 sessions @ $200.00 all.  

Let me know if you'd ever like to host a group at your house.

For individual sessions with someone, I typically do weekly sessions.  Usually 8 sessions to be effective
for you.  I am not covered by insurance at this time.  I could offer a sliding scale
payment. Looking forward to 
sharing more with you. 

I saw children & teens in schools for Hospice.  Look up
your local Hospice for current adult groups for help with loss of your mother.
